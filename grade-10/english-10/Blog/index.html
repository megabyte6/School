                            When I first started programming, I had no idea what I was doing. I was
                            only ten or eleven at the time so, to be honest, I did not know what to
                            expect. I had just dipped my toes into this vast world and played
                            around with all sorts of things without really having a path. I soon
                            realized that I would need to choose a project to work on if I actually
                            wanted to learn how to code. So .....

                                about how computers work. Some things got pretty boring, but I knew
                                that there was always more to be learned so I never lost my hunger for
                                new knowledge.
